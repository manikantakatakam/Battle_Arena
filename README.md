# Executing Battle ARENA

This markdown file provides instructions on how to get started with this ARENA.

## Prerequisites

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure that JDK is installed on your system. You can download and install it from the [official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

## Steps

1. **Open Command Prompt**: Open the command prompt on your system.

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Navigate to the directory where your Java source file is located using the `cd` command. For example:

    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/directory
    ```

3. **Compile the Java Program**: Compile the Java program using the `javac` command followed by the name of your Java source file. For example:

    ```bash
    javac HelloWorld.java
    ```

    This will generate a `.class` file containing the bytecode.

4. **Execute the Program**: Execute the compiled Java program using the `java` command followed by the name of the main class (without the `.class` extension). For example:

    ```bash
    java HelloWorld
    ```

    This will run your Java program and display the output.
